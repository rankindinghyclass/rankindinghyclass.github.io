# R
### Owner
Wallace family
### Provenance
Bought by my brother John Wallace of Whitepoint, Cobh. Used by family in Cobh until his death. I recall tall ships in 1991 being a highlight. Boat transferred to Wexford. His daughter Doirean used the boat and loaned it to me so necessary upkeep and secure storage could happen.
Boat repairs to preserve hull integrity carried out. Delamination of plywood due to water ingress beneath aft seat. All varnish removed from interior and resealed.
Boat still in secure dry storage for occasional use in Wexford. 
No numbers visible on any part of hull including transom.
