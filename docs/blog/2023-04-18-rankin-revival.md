# The Rankin Revival
by Maurice Kidney

### Beginnings
_The Rankin Revival_ as it came to be called was started in 2014 when Conor English and Maurice Kidney got together and put together a database of Rankin boats and their owners.
Much of the boat information came from a meeting of boat owners that was held 4 years previously in Peg Twomeyâ€™s bar in 2010.
Its aim was to revive interest in what was a well-loved local boat.
This meeting was unsuccessful, and another meeting was organised in Jan 2015 in the Donkey Bar.

The objectives of the meeting were -


1. Expand boat register
2. Provide help to boat owners by shared knowledge
3. Direct unused boats to new owners
4. Set up a structure to save/repair damaged boats
5. Build up the historical profile of the class<br> <br>And most importantly -

6. Arrange fun events on the water to encourage use of boats

The meeting, being well attended by boat owners and the objectives being well received, the Rankin Group/Class as we know it today was formed.


### Finding and repairing Rankins

The first success in the search for missing Rankins came when the [_Helga_ ðŸ”—](../boats/tr3.html) â€“ Eric Rankinâ€™s own boat was located and bought from Mick Brennan in Kinsale in 2016. Owen O Connell and Eithne Twomey became the new owners.

A big regret looking back is turning down the â€˜Flower Potâ€™. This was a Rankin in Guileen, in East Cork. She was in bad condition and deemed too far gone to restore.
 When we had a change of heart and went back to get her she had been turned into a Garden feature and planted up accordingly. Lesson learned.

The next Rankin acquired by the group in 2016 was Damien Ahernâ€™s [R16 ðŸ”—](../boats/r16.html) â€“ _Starship Enterprise_. Bought out of Nohoval from Myles Cogan and previously owned by the Burke family, Top of the Hill, Cobh.

February 2017 saw another success in the finding of the missing prototype boat â€“ The Reynoldâ€™s boat.
This was an exciting find as she was a boat that had disappeared off the radar. She was the sister boat to Eddie Twomeyâ€™s [_Fiona_ ðŸ”—](../boats/tr1.html). She was started in Ericâ€™s Boatyard in 1956.
She was found at the back of the Crosshaven Boatyard (in very bad condition) owned by Dick Gibson. A deal was done, John Horgan was the new owner and began the extensive re-construction. 
After 18 months meticulous restoration work, [_Freedom V_ ðŸ”—](../boats/tr2.html) took to the water.

### Traced and converted by the group


2017 also saw the finding of the first of four restoration/ conversion boats traced and restored by the group.

#### Boat no.1
A punt in bad condition which needed to be converted to a sailing dinghy by the addition of a centre board casing. 
The skilled repairs and woodwork were led by Dave O'Keeffe.
She was bought by the Kenny/Doyle/Russell consortium and took to the water in 2018 as [R25 ðŸ”—](../boats/r25.html).

ï¿¼While the Rankin restoration work was ongoing from 2017 to 2023 other boats were sourced and added to the fleet.
