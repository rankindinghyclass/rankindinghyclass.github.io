The earliest solid date we have comes from an <em>Evening Echo</em> article of 10 July 1962 which indicates that the Rankin was already in production by then (fig.1). However, the origins of the design date back to the early 1950s when a cold-moulded prototype that gave birth to the clinker class was built by Eddie Twomey (1917-1976) and Eric Rankin (1926?-1975?). Eddie, another Cobh man, was a wooden boat and sailing enthusiast who introduced Eric to boat building in the 1940s.</p> <p>The story of the prototype and its construction are outlined here. In all, only three of the prototype design were built and they are still going strong today.</p> <p>Eddie Twomey left a number of artifacts including line plans, half-model, notes and photos and Ida Hadley (Eric’s sister) supplied what relevant photos she had to the group. Unfortunately, very little survives from the Rankin Lynch’s Quay workshop and the chronology of building the Rankin clinker production boats is more difficult to establish.</p> <figure> <img src="/images/half-model-rankin.jpg" alt="half model" /> <figcaption>Fig.2 - Half-model of the cold-moulded dinghy prototype made by Eddie Twomey.

Eddie Twomey had planned and built the first T Class dinghy called <em>Dairne</em> in 1945. Other enthusiasts built their own boats, several helped by Eddie, among them, a neophyte Eric, whom Eddie helped build his first boat called <em>Mur Too</em> in the Rankin family home at King’s Terrace.</p> <p>CSC introduced a T Class to its ranks in 1947, ten boats in total being built by 1949. Eddie builds two, Eric three. Other local sailors, JJ O’Mahoney, P Cotter, Keb Sealy, N Casey and TA O’Sullivan also built boats.</p> <h2 id="rankin-workshop"> <a href="#rankin-workshop" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="rankin-workshop"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Rankin workshop </h2> <p>By the late 1940s, Eric has set up as a professional boat builder, opening a workshop in Cobh, first at Bateson’s farm, Bellevue and later at Lynch’s Quay.

The half-model wall mount was made by Eddie for his cousin, Paddy Russell, who owned a Rankin.</p> <figure> <img src="/images/cold-moulded-lines.jpg" alt="Cold moulded plans" /> <figcaption>Fig.4 - Part of lines plan of prototype showing superimposed tender lines (Twomey Collection).</figcaption> </figure> <h2 id="construction-methods"> <a href="#construction-methods" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="construction-methods"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Construction methods </h2> <p>The Rankin is built using the clinker/lapstrake method in which plywood planks overlap each other and are secured with glue. However, the prototype of the Rankin design used a very different construction method, that of cold-moulding, in which a series of veneers/laminates is shaped on a mould and glued together to form the hull. Fairey Marine in the U.K., capitalising on their experience building wood-laminate wartime aircraft (as Fairey Aviation Company) marketed one of the first mass-produced laminated dinghies in 1946, the <em>Firefly</em>, an Uffa Fox design. Because of the limitations of the glues at the time, however, those dinghies were hot-moulded by being placed in a large autoclave to enable the glue to set at the higher temperature and pressure required. By the 1950’s new glues that would set at room temperature and with sufficient pressure provided by stapling the veneers together became available and this put the technique within reach of the home builder.</p> <figure> <img src="/images/scan10253-s.jpg" alt="Cold moulded dinghy" /> <figcaption>Fig.5 - Cold-moulded dinghy prototypes <i>Fiona</i> (front) and Reynolds (rear) under construction at Lynch's Quay workshop.

Costing was hardly a factor. A back-of-the-envelope estimate (fig.6) of planked vs moulded by Eddie indicates that moulded was somewhat cheaper but the cost does not include the glue. Eddie would certainly have been aware of new building techniques, e.g., a note of his, dated 9 May 1947, in reference to the hot-moulded <em>Firefly</em> around the time of its introduction states <em>“skin 3/16” resin bonded moulded ply”</em>. However, the likely impetus for choosing cold-moulding was the introduction of the cold-moulded 5o5s in 1954. This international class rapidly took off, with workshops like George Bush’s in Ringaskiddy importing hulls for finishing. Cobh man Joe Stromsoe who was an apprentice in Eric’s workshop from 1952 to 1957 remembers accompanying Eddie and Eric on a somewhat alarming passage by sail over to Ringaskiddy to George Bush’s workshop to see the 5o5s being finished there.</p> <p>In contrast, over 1956-57, Eric actually built three 5o5s from scratch. These were <em>Wow</em> for John Maher, <em>Thalia</em> for international rugby player, PJ O’Meara, and <em>Three Star</em> for H.O. Hennessy. Joe Stromsoe also recalls O’Meara visiting the workshop with Ted Crosbie who already had his own 5o5 (from George Bush’s workshop in Ringaskiddy).</p> <figure> <img src="/images/scan10254-s.jpg" alt="Cold moulded dinghy" /> <figcaption>Fig.7 - Eddie Twomey working on the <i>Fiona</i> in the Lynch's Quay workshop. The Reynolds boat is just about visible in the upper right (Twomey Collection).</figcaption> </figure> <p>It was J. Clayton Love who introduced the 5o5 class to Ireland. His boat, <em>Miss Betty II</em> made her debut in a race from Crosshaven to Aghada on 24th April 1955. By 1957 there were four in the class in Cork Harbour, the latest being O’Meara’s <em>Three Star</em>. By July 1957, the 5o5 class in the IDRA championships in Crosshaven included 12 entries, seven being Irish and five from Cork.</p> <p>We know that Eric completed the Maher boat <em>WOW</em> in August 1956, a month after the completion of the prototypes, because the Cork Examiner, 23rd August 1956, had a piece on the Maher 5o5 indicating that she was the first one built in the country:</p> <blockquote> <p>A boat … now lying on Robinson’s Slip in Cobh … is the 5-0-5 WOW built to the order of those well known Cork Harbour sailing brothers Messrs R. and M. Maher by the young Cobh boat-builder Mr. Eric Rankin in his workshops on Lynch’s Quay … The boat, first of its class to be built in Ireland …</p> </blockquote> <p>In photos of the Lynch’s Quay workshop around 1955/56 the Fiona and Reynolds boat are shown with a 5o5 mould in the background suggesting that 5o5 construction was occurring concurrently (although why the <em>WOW</em> was launched late, missing the 1956 sailing season, is hard to explain). In another photo, two 5o5s are under construction simultaneously with no sign of the Rankin prototypes. We can surmise that these are the O’Meara and Hennessy boats, under construction in 1956/57 as we know O’Meara’s boat made her debut in 1957.</p> <p>This adoption of the cold-moulding technique in 1955/56 must surely put the prototypes amongst the first cold-moulded boats to be built in Ireland.</p> <h2 id="uk-sojourn"> <a href="#uk-sojourn" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="uk-sojourn"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> UK sojourn </h2> <p>In late 1957 (as confirmed by Joe Stromsoe and Ida Hadley) Eric moved to England to work. He spent time at three workshops: Fairey Marine Yard, Southampton, South Devon Boatbuilders Company, Dawlish and Morgan Giles, Teignmouth. Details become scarce at this stage - about how long Eric was away - but he did resume building at Lynch’s Quay by 1960. In that year, with his brother David, he built the third of the cold-moulded dinghies and an 8ft yacht tender version. These were displayed in Dublin during Easter week at a boat show that was raising funds to send a yachting team to the Olympic Games. The Rankins won 2nd prize in the professional builders category. This third boat became Eric’s own boat and was named <em>Helga</em>.</p> <figure> <img src="/images/3-prototypes-l.jpg" alt="Cold moulded dinghies" /> <figcaption>Fig.8 - The three cold-moulded dinghies together: (l to r) Fiona, Freedom V, Helga.

This is one of the early builds, if not the first (Rankin Collection).</figcaption> </figure> <p>Eric may have been incentivised to explore methods of “mass production” based on what he experienced in the UK boat yards which led to the clinker version of what subsequently became the standard Rankin dinghy. The clinker version would be less labour intensive to produce than the cold-moulded one. In any case, Eric adapted the forms of the cold-moulded dinghy to make the clinker one (as related to Éamonn Twomey by his father Eddie). Eddie appears to have still been involved in the testing and rigging of the new design (fig.9,10) but hereon fades out of the picture.</p> <p>The new revised design proved to be popular and over the next three decades the Rankin workshop headed by Eric and later David and with the assistance of several associates and apprentices produced some 80+ boats.</p> <figure> <img src="/images/eddie-eric-series.jpg" alt="eddie and eric sailing" /> <figcaption>Fig.10 - Eddie and Eric sailing in an early Bermudan rigged clinker Ranklin (Rankin Collection).</figcaption> </figure> <h2 id="acknowledgements"> <a href="#acknowledgements" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="acknowledgements"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Acknowledgements </h2> <p>Thanks to Owen O’Connell for sharing newspaper archive search results, Dermot Burns (archivist, RCYC), for pinning down some 5o5 dates and Conor English for providing contacts.
