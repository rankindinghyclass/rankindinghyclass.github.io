    "content": "by Owen O’Connell . In early February, 2021, Dave O’Keeffe and Owen O’Connell set out to build a new Rankin, the first in 24 years, and only the second (Dave built himself a Rankin in 1997) since the close of the Rankin workshop in the late 1980s. This was made possible because Dave had purchased the Rankin boat mould when the workshop closed, and of course, he had the skills needed for building a boat. In this blog post, significant milestones along the way are highlighted. February 9, 2021 . Transom knee made up using a template on our new router table. February 11, 2021 . Transom and Transom Stiffner made up using a 9mm plywood template . February 15, 2021 . Transom glued up and rough shaped . February 16, 2021 . Fore foot cut from 1 7/8 inch thick Iroko using original Rankin template. February 16, 2021 . We screwed and glued all the centreline timbers (transom, transom knee, hog, fore foot and apron) over the Rankin mould / jig. The mould is the original mould that was built by Eric Rankin and used by himself and his brother David from the early 1960’s to the late 1980’s. Dave O’Keeffe purchased the mould when the contents of the Rankin workshop at Lynch’s Quay were sold off and has had it in safe keeping every since. February 17, 2021 . Fairing the apron to the mould and to accept the future planking. February 18, 2021 . Today we made up a template to match the sheer line of the mould, this will then be matched against an existing Rankin dinghy and then used to cut the curve for a new “dinosaur”! . February 19, 2021 . Having faired the template to match the inside curve of the gunwale, we laid it out on a large slab of pitch pine 11’ long x 14” wide x 4 1/2” thick and started to cut. February 20, 2021 . The “Dinosaur” being glued and clamped and fixed with coach bolts and 150mm long screws, meanwhile Dave started fairing the hog and transom to recieve the garboard planks. February 22, 2021 . The “Dinosaur” now cleaned down and in its upright position with floor brackets fitted, the angle blocks still need to be secured. The curved face has been faired with electric plane, then block plane and finished off with the sander. February 24, 2021 . Drawing down the 1st of 6 sheets of 6mm ply (Robins Super Elite Plus) for cutting using the garboard template. Then scarfing the fore and aft sections of the plank together. The plastic is used to resist the glue and keep the timber clean. February 24, 2021 . Final fairing on the Hog ,Forefoot and Apron with a dry run on the bendy bit of the Garboard, to check the lands. February 25, 2021 . More clamps arrived today, meanwhile we dry fitted the starboard garboard, scarfed and glued the port garboard and cut out the next set of planks . February 26, 2021 . Drilling a 30mm dia hole in in each of the 44 number 400 x 60 x 25 mm thick pieces of plywood, which will form the spikes on the back of the Dinosaur. The newly arrived Epoxy delivery ready for glueing up the planking. February 28, 2021 . Finally we got the 1st garboard plank glued up and clamped on the mould yesterday; clamps and tape removed today. Only 13 more to go!! . March 1, 2021 . Dry run using ratchet straps to hold down the 2nd Garboard, screws and blocks did not prove man enough at the turn of the Garboard around the Forefoot. Time was also spent setting up the spikes on the”Dinosaur”. March 4, 2021 . 60 years on and some things never change. March 4, 2021 . The 3rd plank glued and clamped today, using U shaped rebar and wooden wedges. The “Dinosaur” nearing completion, this will be used to bend the gunnels when the time comes. March 5, 2021 . 4th plank on, glued and clamped. Dave applying glue to the land of the 5th plank, the yellow tape on the reverse of the plank is to protect against glue squeeze out. March 10, 2021 . Checking the fairing on the bottom of the 5th plank by setting up stations at every 100mm on the 4th plank of the existing Rankin and recording the visible width. Then transfering that information on to the new 4th plank and marking the bottom edge of the rough cut 5th plank. Dave then fairs to this line. Planks 8 and 9 were fitted today. March 11, 2021 . Today was cutting out planks 13 &amp; 14; yes the last ones (also known as the “Whiskey” plank) The planks are cut using the templates we previously made. They are cut 6mm over size to allow for any change in the lay of the plank as it is bent on the mould. Plank 10 was fixed today as well as gluing up the scarfs on planks 11 &amp; 12. March 14, 2021 . Each plank in made from near enough a sheet and a half length of ply, a scarf (scarph) joint is made to connect the two pieces, the plywood being 6 mm thick means the scarf is 54mm wide ( a 1 in 9 slope). The joint is glued and clamped. The finished product shows the “S” shape of the top 2 sets of planks on the Rankin - there’s more to planks than meets the eye. March 15, 2021 . Working on the 11th plank, following the final dry fit, a datum line is drawn the length of the plank. The width of the plank is measured either side of this datum every 100mm along the length of the plank. This information will be used to produce CNC planks in the future (the tape is to record the values while keeping the plank clean) The plank is then glued and clamped, lots of clamps were used in fixing this plank so not enough clamps to do plank 12 today. March 22, 2021 . Plank 14 (the Whiskey plank) fitted this morning. No time to celebrate 🍺 as we are moving on to fit the keel this afternoon. March 23, 2021 . Dave fitted the deadwood which was scribed to the shape of the hull and glued on above the keel and below the future apron. Meanwhile I opened out the slot for the daggerboard and made up the running boards out of 27 x 17mm strips of Iroko. March 23, 2021 . The Keel was shaped, fitted, glued and braced from the ceiling. It was made from a piece of 10ft long, 120mm x 40mm Iroko. The gap in the middle is for the dagger board slot. Cheek pieces will be added after the slot is cut to final dimensions. March 24, 2021 . Several workfaces today. | The apron was rough shaped, glued and braced in place. | The front end of the keel and the deadwood started to be shaped. | The cheeks of the daggerboard box were shaped, glued and clamped in place. | The first of the running boards was glued and braced in place ( this proved problematic so a jig was made up to hold them in place for when we glue them tomorrow). | Completed trimming and fairing the planks at the transom. | . March 25, 2021 . A forest of braces holding down the running boards while 2 sets of jigs hold then in place.The signature Rankin shape of the stem can be seen as Dave continued to shape the apron. March 26, 2021 . Turned the right way up today. R to L: mould, new shell, finished product. March 28, 2021 . 61 years after the 1st Rankin came off this very same mould a new Rankin is born. Many thanks to Bud for providing the workshop space to carry out this very special project. March 30, 2021 . After the excitement of turning the boat the boring task of cleaning the glue lines progresses. April 2, 2021 . Glue lines and glue stains cleaned off the shell, next stage is to make the templates and jig for the install of the twarths and stern seat assembly as advised by Mike O Sullivan (who spent his misspent youth in the Rankin Workshop). April 6, 2021 . New block plane and spokeshave eased the work involved in making the templates for the aft seat assembly. April 14, 2021 . Templates and jigs, the new seat assembly jig completed and on the wall with the rest of the Rankin templates. April 15, 2021 . Making templates for the bottom (floor)boards, used heavy guage paper fixed over the boards of the existing Rankin using Prit Stick and then cut around the boards with a scissors to make the templates. The templates were then peeled off and laid on a sheet of ply, marked and cut out with a jigsaw. Final fairing done with a block plane. May 7, 2021 . Having made the templates for the aft seat assembly the next task is to rough cut out the Iroko close to the line and finish off the pieces on the router table. May 9, 2021 . The consensus was to use a stringer under the side seats (as per the early rankins) for support rather than the “ hourglass” support (seen on most of the later Rankins. This was done by making a concave jig to match the seat profile then gluing and screwing a length of 38x18 Siberian Larch in place. May 10, 2021 . All the pieces of the stern seat assembly were laid in the jig, glued and screwed, (the yellow pvc tape was to protect the wood from glue seepage) After 24 hrs the assembly was removed from the jig and cleaned down ( the pvc tape was not the best). May 11, 2021 . All 6 seat supports made using template and router. One edge was then beveled to match the inside curve of the hull while ensuring the top surface remained on the same plane as its opposite number on the other side of the boat. Extra long rebar clamps are used to hold the piece in place while checking the fit. May 18, 2021 . Following glue clean up on the underside of the seat supports, the shell was turned ( Maurice lending a hand) and the aft seat assembly was screwed and glued down, the forward seat is screwed only as it needs to be removed when we come to fit the dagger board box. May 20, 2021 . Working on the struts that support the triangular shaped floorboard and shaping the pieces that make up the daggerboard box using templates and router. May 23, 2021 . Working on making up the daggerboard box, the stiffners on the top and bottom of the “box” kindly milled to size by James Burke, the plastic is to ensure the two sides are no glued together prematurely before a melamine liner is glued to the inside faces of the “box”. … to be continued … .

    "content": "Image: Eithne Twomey . The Rankin dinghy is a 12ft 9in glued plywood clinker boat, powered by sail, oar or outboard motor, produced by the Rankin brothers, Eric and David, at their workshop on Lynch’s Quay in the harbour town of Cobh, Co. Cork, Ireland. Established there at the start of the 1950s, early commissions included 20ft salmon yawls, 15ft and 17ft fishing boats, cold-moulded 5o5s, a set of 30 14ft oars for the Irish Naval Service, a rowing eight for Cork Rowing Club, an Uffa Fox 18 footer and, of course, the Rankin dinghy. The Rankin proved to be a bouyant, safe boat, well suited for family boating adventures in choppy harbour conditions. The first Rankin was built in the early 1960s. The design became very popular and subsequently over 80 were produced until the close of the Rankin workshop in the late 1980s. Thanks to Maurice Kidney and Conor English, who each began to raise awareness of the boat, a “Rankin revival” commenced around 2014 and a local, informal group led by Maurice, Conor and Owen O’Connell convened to promote the class, rescuing and renovating boats, organising sailing events, and even building new Rankins. We are documenting all aspects of this wooden boat class here, including history, the boats themselves, and occasional articles on the ongoing life of the Rankin dinghy class. Email Rankin Dinghy .

The earliest solid date we have comes from an Evening Echo article of 10 July 1962 which indicates that the Rankin was already in production by then (fig.1). However, the origins of the design date back to the early 1950s when a cold-moulded prototype that gave birth to the clinker class was built by Eddie Twomey (1917-1976) and Eric Rankin (1926?-1975?). Eddie, another Cobh man, was a wooden boat and sailing enthusiast who introduced Eric to boat building in the 1940s. The story of the prototype and its construction are outlined here. In all, only three of the prototype design were built and they are still going strong today. Eddie Twomey left a number of artifacts including line plans, half-model, notes and photos and Ida Hadley (Eric’s sister) supplied what relevant photos she had to the group. Unfortunately, very little survives from the Rankin Lynch’s Quay workshop and the chronology of building the Rankin clinker production boats is more difficult to establish.

However, the prototype of the Rankin design used a very different construction method, that of cold-moulding, in which a series of veneers/laminates is shaped on a mould and glued together to form the hull. Fairey Marine in the U.K., capitalising on their experience building wood-laminate wartime aircraft (as Fairey Aviation Company) marketed one of the first mass-produced laminated dinghies in 1946, the Firefly, an Uffa Fox design. Because of the limitations of the glues at the time, however, those dinghies were hot-moulded by being placed in a large autoclave to enable the glue to set at the higher temperature and pressure required. By the 1950’s new glues that would set at room temperature and with sufficient pressure provided by stapling the veneers together became available and this put the technique within reach of the home builder.

    "content": "Fig.6 - Back-of-the-envelope comparison of the costs of building planked vs moulded hull (Twomey Collection). The choice of cold-moulding is interesting. Costing was hardly a factor. A back-of-the-envelope estimate (fig.6) of planked vs moulded by Eddie indicates that moulded was somewhat cheaper but the cost does not include the glue. Eddie would certainly have been aware of new building techniques, e.g., a note of his, dated 9 May 1947, in reference to the hot-moulded Firefly around the time of its introduction states “skin 3/16” resin bonded moulded ply”. However, the likely impetus for choosing cold-moulding was the introduction of the cold-moulded 5o5s in 1954. This international class rapidly took off, with workshops like George Bush’s in Ringaskiddy importing hulls for finishing. Cobh man Joe Stromsoe who was an apprentice in Eric’s workshop from 1952 to 1957 remembers accompanying Eddie and Eric on a somewhat alarming passage by sail over to Ringaskiddy to George Bush’s workshop to see the 5o5s being finished there. In contrast, over 1956-57, Eric actually built three 5o5s from scratch. These were Wow for John Maher, Thalia for international rugby player, PJ O’Meara, and Three Star for H.O. Hennessy. Joe Stromsoe also recalls O’Meara visiting the workshop with Ted Crosbie who already had his own 5o5 (from George Bush’s workshop in Ringaskiddy). Fig.7 - Eddie Twomey working on the Fiona in the Lynch's Quay workshop. The Reynolds boat is just about visible in the upper right (Twomey Collection). It was J. Clayton Love who introduced the 5o5 class to Ireland. His boat, Miss Betty II made her debut in a race from Crosshaven to Aghada on 24th April 1955. By 1957 there were four in the class in Cork Harbour, the latest being O’Meara’s Three Star. By July 1957, the 5o5 class in the IDRA championships in Crosshaven included 12 entries, seven being Irish and five from Cork. We know that Eric completed the Maher boat WOW in August 1956, a month after the completion of the prototypes, because the Cork Examiner, 23rd August 1956, had a piece on the Maher 5o5 indicating that she was the first one built in the country: . A boat … now lying on Robinson’s Slip in Cobh … is the 5-0-5 WOW built to the order of those well known Cork Harbour sailing brothers Messrs R. and M. Maher by the young Cobh boat-builder Mr. Eric Rankin in his workshops on Lynch’s Quay … The boat, first of its class to be built in Ireland … . In photos of the Lynch’s Quay workshop around 1955/56 the Fiona and Reynolds boat are shown with a 5o5 mould in the background suggesting that 5o5 construction was occurring concurrently (although why the WOW was launched late, missing the 1956 sailing season, is hard to explain). In another photo, two 5o5s are under construction simultaneously with no sign of the Rankin prototypes. We can surmise that these are the O’Meara and Hennessy boats, under construction in 1956/57 as we know O’Meara’s boat made her debut in 1957. This adoption of the cold-moulding technique in 1955/56 must surely put the prototypes amongst the first cold-moulded boats to be built in Ireland. ",

    "content": "In late 1957 (as confirmed by Joe Stromsoe and Ida Hadley) Eric moved to England to work. He spent time at three workshops: Fairey Marine Yard, Southampton, South Devon Boatbuilders Company, Dawlish and Morgan Giles, Teignmouth. Details become scarce at this stage - about how long Eric was away - but he did resume building at Lynch’s Quay by 1960. In that year, with his brother David, he built the third of the cold-moulded dinghies and an 8ft yacht tender version. These were displayed in Dublin during Easter week at a boat show that was raising funds to send a yachting team to the Olympic Games. The Rankins won 2nd prize in the professional builders category. This third boat became Eric’s own boat and was named Helga. Fig.8 - The three cold-moulded dinghies together: (l to r) Fiona, Freedom V, Helga. (Image courtesy of Marion Horgan). Only three full sized cold-moulded dinghies were made although Eric may have built some additional boat tenders. The three dinghies are still going strong after 60+ years (fig.8), the Fiona with Eddie Twomey’s grandson, James Burke, the Helga with Owen O’Connell, and the Reynolds boat (now named Freedom V), recently bought and beautifully renovated by John Horgan. It must be said that without the expert sleuthing of Maurice Kidney, the Helga and Reynolds boat might not be back in Cobh. ",

Eric may have been incentivised to explore methods of “mass production” based on what he experienced in the UK boat yards which led to the clinker version of what subsequently became the standard Rankin dinghy. The clinker version would be less labour intensive to produce than the cold-moulded one. In any case, Eric adapted the forms of the cold-moulded dinghy to make the clinker one (as related to Éamonn Twomey by his father Eddie). Eddie appears to have still been involved in the testing and rigging of the new design (fig.9,10) but hereon fades out of the picture. The new revised design proved to be popular and over the next three decades the Rankin workshop headed by Eric and later David and with the assistance of several associates and apprentices produced some 80+ boats.
